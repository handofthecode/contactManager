# contactManager
Contact Manager is a user-friendly app that helps you organize people. Contacts are automatically sorted by first name but the search feature will help find contacts even more quickly by allowing you to search by tag category and name simultaneously.  
Input validation will help prevent typos and your contact data is automatically stored in the local storage so if you close your browser or refresh the page, your contacts will remain safe.
